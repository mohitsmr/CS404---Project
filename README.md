# CS404---Project

Introduction:
The BeagleBone is quite a powerful tool when it comes to home automation, because it provides easy access to the web and lots of GPIOs.

In this project youâ€™ll create a web server that controls outputs and it can be accessed remotely with your smartphone, tablet or laptop.
Installation:
Make sure you have an Internet connection through a network cable or Wifi. Connect to the BeagleBone Black by SSH. Set the current time just to be sure:

/usr/bin/ntpdate -b -s -u pool.ntp.org
Install Socket.IO:

cd /var/lib/cloud9
npm install socket.io
